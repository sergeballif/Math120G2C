Models of Teaching
==================


Activity based learning
-----------------------

The activity could be done in class. Then the online activity would be 
nightly homework (in addition to any regular homework).

Quantitative questions are graded as usual. Free-response questions are 
graded on the basis of completion. 


A complete online course
------------------------

Short 0-7 minute videos can be included with the `\youtube` tag or
`\video` tag. From this one can build a whole lecture, giving
coherence to the list of videos.
