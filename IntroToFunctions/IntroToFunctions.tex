\subsection*{Basic learning objectives}

These are the tasks you should be able to perform with reasonable fluency \textbf{when you arrive at our next class meeting}. Important new vocabulary words are indicated \emph{in italics}. 

\begin{itemize}
	\item Know the difference between functions and other relations.
	\item Be able to use \url{http://desmos.com} to enter functions and obtain tables of function values.
	\item Know how to use function notation to evaluate a function.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Advanced learning objectives}

In addition to mastering the basic objectives, here are the tasks you should be able to perform \textbf{after class, with practice}: 

\begin{itemize}
	\item Know how to model a function as a graph, a formula, and a table.
	\item Know how to find functions to algebraically model real-world applications.
    \item Understand the difference between the dependent variable and the independent variable.
\end{itemize}
